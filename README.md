# The Veggie Patch

As my Milestone Project 3 for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course,
I have built an application where people are able to find and share vegetarian recipes with each other.

The application can be found at ....

## UX
The application is meant to be a platform for people who are interested in vegetarian cooking,
to get inspired and find and share recipes with each other.\
Data for the app is kept in a MongoDB document-based database with two collections.\
The app incorporates the four basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions, and it was created using HTML, Flask, Jinja templating and CSS.

### User stories
1. as a user I want to be able to browse all recipes for inspiration
2. as a user looking for a specific type of recipe, I want to be able to filter on meal type
3. as a user looking to use up some ingredients, I want to be able to perform a search based on ingredients
3. as a user I want an easy overview of required ingredients
4. as a user I want to be able to print out a clean, well-structured copy of the recipe
5. as a user I want to be able to share recipes with other users
6. as a user who previously added a recipe, I want to be able to edit or delete it

### Wireframes
Wireframes for this project were created for [small screens](static/wireframes/small-screens.pdf)
and for [medium and up](static/wireframes/medium-large-screens.pdf). The decision to roll wireframes for medium and large screens into one
was taken when it quickly became clear that they would only have minor differences. Apart from the navigation bar being collapsed on medium-sized screens,
they are largely identical.

Differences between the wireframes and the actual layout are discussed in the [Features](#features) section below.

### Database
The data for this project is stored in a MongoDB database with two collections:\
**Categories collection**:
| Field Name  | Data Type |
| ------------|-----------|
| _id         | ObjectId  |
|category_name|String     |
|category_url |String     |

**Recipes collection**:
| Field Name   | Data Type |
|--------------|-----------|
|_id           |ObjectId   |
|name          |String     |
|category_name |String     |
|prep_time     |Integer    |
|cook_time     |Integer    |
|serves        |String     |
|ingredients   |Array      |
|image_url     |String     |
|instructions  |String     |
|id_key        |String     |
|total_time    |Integer    | 

The two collections have the category_name field in common.
This is so that it is possible to return recipes belonging to a specific category when that category is chosen in the category view.\
The ingredients are stored in an array in order to be able to display them on separate lines in an unordered list.\
total_time is the sum of prep_time and cook_time and it is not visible to the user, but is used for the filter function where users can
look up recipes based on how long it takes to make them.

## Features
### Design and layout
This is a multi-page app with a clean, user-friendly design. All pages make use of the same colour scheme and fonts and all have the same fixed-top navbar and footer.
Where the same elements are rendered on multiple pages at different times (for example cards showing an image and a name for a recipe),
the look is always identical to ensure smooth transitions and ecognisability.\
For the header, footer and borders a dark green (#026318) was used as green is associated with vegetables and this is a platform for sharing vegetarian recipes.\
Where text appears on a coloured background, the color is set to white to ensure it is easy to read.\
The logo was designed with [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and consists of an image of tomatoes next to the name of the website in white on the green background.
A playful, relaxed font, Just Another Hand, was chosen to convey a sense of fun and informality. For all other text on the website, the font Cambay is used as it is a simple, sans-serif font which is easier on the eyes when reading on a screen.

### Existing Features
The app incorporates the 4 CRUD functionalities:
- CREATE
  * Adding a recipe: the user has the option to add a recipe to the database by clicking on the "Add a Recipe" link in the navigation bar.
  Doing so will open a form that the user can fill out with recipe name, category, time it takes to prepare and cook, number of servings,
  ingredients, instructions and an image URL.\
  The user also has to provide a key that they need to remember in case they want to edit the recipe later.
- READ
  * Browsing: the landing-page displays all recipes in the database, and it is possible for users to scroll down and get inspired.
  * Filtering on Categories: by clicking on "Categories" in the navigation bar and then on a category card, it is possible for the user to only see the recipes belonging to that category (for example breakfast or desserts).
  * Searching: by clicking on "Search" in the navigation bar, the user is taken to a searchbox where they are able to search for recipes based on ingredients and names.
  This was set up by creating an index on the name and ingredients fields in the MongoDB database.
  * Viewing a recipe: when a recipe card is clicked, the user is taken to the recipe view where they can see info, ingredients and instructions for that recipe.
- UPDATE & DELETE
  * Editing and deleting a recipe: the recipe view has an edit button the user can click if they wish to update or delete the recipe.
  In order to restrict access to these functions, the edit form will only open once the correct key has been entered (the key provided when the recipe was first added).
  This ensures that only the person who added the recipe is able to change or delete it.\
  The edit form autopopulates with the data from the MongoDB database and there is a checkbox that needs to be checked in order to delete the recipe completely.
  A checkbox is less likely to be clicked by accident than a button which is why this design was chosen.
- Feedback: Flash messages are displayed when a user has added, updated or deleted a recipe.

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies and Tools Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python were used to build the webpage
